# DL4NLP-MuTual

This is an analysis of the MuTual paper. We reproduce the work for the BERT model. We improve these results by implementing augmentations on the data.

## Datset

The dataset from the MuTual paper can be downloaded at [MuTual: A Dataset for Multi-Turn Dialogue Reasoning](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.130/) (ACL2020). The statistics of the data can be seen at the MuTual [GitHub](https://github.com/Nealcly/MuTual/blob/master/README.md) page.


## Models

The focus will be on the the BERT model.

### BERT

The BERT model can be found at the [GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/bert) page.
